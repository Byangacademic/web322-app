          Massive Open Worlds: MMOs are known for their vast and immersive open
          worlds. From sprawling fantasy realms to futuristic sci-fi cities,
          these virtual landscapes are filled with diverse environments,
          including lush forests, treacherous dungeons, towering mountains, and
          bustling cities. Exploring these worlds and uncovering hidden secrets
          is a thrilling aspect of MMO gameplay.

          Social Interaction: MMOs are built around social interaction, enabling
          players to connect with each other in a virtual community. Whether
          it's joining guilds, participating in player-run events, or simply
          chatting with fellow adventurers, MMOs foster a sense of camaraderie
          and cooperation among players.

          Player vs. Environment (PvE): MMOs often offer a rich PvE experience,
          where players can embark on epic quests, defeat challenging monsters
          and bosses, and unravel deep storylines. PvE content can range from
          solo adventures to group-based raids, requiring coordination and
          teamwork to overcome powerful adversaries.
